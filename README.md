# Project Setup and Execution

This project requires **Node v21.6.1** or higher and **npm v10.4.0**. However, it is recommended to use `pnpm` for a faster experience.

To run the app, use the command: `pnpm run dev`

To perform an ESLint check across the entire app and fix issues, use the command: `pnpm run fix`

To run the tests, use the command: `pnpm run test`
(I have no experience with the tests, but I was able to configure the dependencies to make them work and to add a few basic tests. I consider tests to be very important and Iâ€™m looking forward to gaining those skills.)
